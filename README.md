# System and Context Boundaries
## System Context

-> the real part to geather the requirenments of the system. this is called system context.

-> identifying the materiel and immaterial of the system.
-> what will be the practical shape of the system ( for better understanding of requirements).
-> For better understanding interaction of the system and user is identified.
-> People, System in operation, process, Events and Documents are part of system context.
-> incomplete system context can cause into the failure of the application.

## system boundries
The system boundary separates the system that is to be developed from its
environment; i.e., it separates the part of the reality that can be modified or
altered by the development process from aspects of the environment that
cannot be changed or modified by the development process.
### source and sink
source provides the input to the system while the sink provides the output.
stakeholders are the source while the system is the sink
## Context Boundries 
The context boundary separates the relevant part of the environment of a
system to be developed from the irrelevant part, i.e., the part that does not
influence the system to be developed and, thus, does not have to be considered
during requirements engineering.

the grey zone between the system and system context must be resolved. while it is not complusory to resolve the grey zone between system context and irrelevant envirnoments.
